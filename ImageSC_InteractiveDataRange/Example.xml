  <Description>
    This example creates an ImageSC plot with a colorbar and two slider controls. The sliders are used to determine the lower and upper range of the data 
    which correspond to the lower and upper color range of the colormap. Moving one slider immediately cause the imagesc plot to update its colors. The colorbar
    updates its range.
