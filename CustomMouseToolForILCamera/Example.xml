  <Title>Custom Mouse Tool with Camera</Title>
  <Description>
    The example demonstrates the implementation of a custom mouse tool: the user can select between standard mouse handling (rotating) for
    a common Camera scene and a custom mouse tool. Latter draws a selection rectangle over the scene in a 2D style. The example prepares
    for handling the 2D coordinates after the mouse is released. Once the mouse is released it prints a message box with the 2D viewport coordinates of the selection 
    rectangle.
