  <Title>An interactive Cube of Cubes</Title>
  <Description>
    This example creates a number of cubes arranged to form a 3D block. All cubes are based on the same, single instance from the ILNumerics.Drawing.Shapes collection. 
    Hence, they all share the same vertices. By placing them into individual group nodes we can configure certain properties individually: position, color, opacity. 
    The mouse event for 'double click' is registered to reset the camera view to the initial default view. It is shown, how this interactive 
    property is acting on the synchronized copy of the main scene.
