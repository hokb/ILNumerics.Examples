  <Title>Plotting in a WebApp</Title>
  <Description>
    <p>A simple website is created from a ASP.NET Core Web App template. It generates a 3d plot on the server and updates an image on the client page dynamically. The user can rotate the plot cube arbitrarily. The result is displayed when she clicks on [Submit].</p>
    <p>
      This example demonstrates how to render scenes offline, i.e.: without a GUI framework providing a rendering target. The images are generated utilizing the GDI+ driver. It supports all features of the default (OpenGL) driver but does not require a graphics adapter.
      This method is recommended when rendering scenes on a server. See here for details: <a href="https://ilnumerics.net/offscreen-rendering.html">ILNumerics offscreen rendering documentation</a>.
