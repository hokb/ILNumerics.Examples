  <Title>Forward &amp; Backward FFT with Hanning Window</Title>
  <Description>
    This example implements FFT operations. It first generates and applies a window function to a sampled signal and transforms the 
    result into the frequency domain. Some simple modifications are made to the frequency spectrum before the 
    'signal' is transformed back into the time domain. This example does not utilize a Computing Module but rather implements the 
    simple code directly into the one and only method of a console application.
