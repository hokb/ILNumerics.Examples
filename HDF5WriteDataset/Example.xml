  <Description>
    <![CDATA[<p>
    This example demonstrates basic HDF5 handling in ILNumerics. A new HDF5 file is created and a dataset is added. 
    The dataset is read back in fully and partially using hyperslabs (subarrays in ILNumerics), columns and rows are appended and altered, attributes are created and iterated.
