  <Title>Selecting Data Coordinates with the Mouse</Title>
  <Description>
    This example labels the current mouse position in the coordinates of a line plot. It uses an inverted render pipeline 
    to translate the viewport coordinates of the mouse into the data space (model) coordinate of the line plot group object, hosted in a plot cube. 
    The coordinates are displayed in the forms title bar as text and updated while the mouse is moving over the scene.
