  <Title>Flat Shading Colormap</Title>
  <Description>
    This example creates a colormap which can be used to simulate a flat shaded coloring. Keypoints from an
    existing colormap are used as a starting point. Replicated keypoints are used to create flat areas
    in the colormap. The colormap is than utilized in order to color example terrain data in a surface plot. The example
    shows the surface based on the modified colormap as well as the same data colored with the original colormap. 
    Both plots are arranged on the same panel for easier comparison. Colorbars are added to each surface which show the corresponding colormap.
