  <Title>Stacking objects on top of each other</Title>
  <Description>
    The example shows an ImageSC plot and a line plot. The line plot is rendered on top of the imagesc plot - regardless of its 3d coordinates. 
    Interactivity is handled separately, depending on which object the mouse is currently over: when starting a drag operation over the 2D line plots a 
    2D selection rectangle allows to control the zoom settings of the line plot only. When starting to drag with the left mouse over the 3D plot a regular
    rotation operation is performed on the 3D plot only.
