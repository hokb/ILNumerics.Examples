  <Description>
    Example demonstrating how to utilize the Cell array type in order to query complex multityped data from storages like DBs and use them as a container for efficient data storage, -transport and -retrieval.
    A 'query' function is implemented which returns a Cell with string and numerical array data as elements (in a data table fashion). Data is returned to the 
    main function and stored into a *.mat file by help of the MatFile class.
