  <Title>Titles on Scenes Example</Title>
  <Description><![CDATA[
    <p>Titles display text in a bordered box on top of regular objects in the sceme. This example creates 
    several titles on top of a simple scene. One title is created for each predefined positioning value. 
    Custom configuration of titles is demonstrated by creating a title with a larger font and configuring 
    larger padding values for it. The additional area is used to place several shapes on the title. </p>
    <p>The titles can be moved with the mouse - functionality derived from ScreenObject. As common for 
    all scene objects in ILNumerics Visualization Engine the objects contained are freely configurable: 
    Border, Background, Label and all custom content.</p>]]>
