  <Title>Reuse Plotting Forms (instead of recreating them)</Title>
  <Description>
This example demonstrates how to reuse your Panel plotting forms. 
Instead of closing and recreating them later it is better to reuse the form. 
A simple modification is done to the plotting form to redirect the Close() 
call to a Hide() only. Form1 serves as the main/startup form. It maintains a 
reference to the plotting_form. Instead of repeatedly recreating the plotting_form
it simply calls Show() on the single, local instance 'myForm'.
