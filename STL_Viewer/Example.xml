  <Title>STL Model Viewer (.NET 5.0, WindowsForms)</Title>
  <Description>
This app serves as a working STL model viewer. It loads the famous 'bunny.stl' (C. Stanford, included) 
at startup. The model is viewed in a regular Camera node, i.e.: one can interact by rotation, translation, panning and zoom. 
<p>Other models can be loaded from STL files. For display a Triangles shape is used. Lighting is enabled.</p>
    <p>Single clicking on the model with the left mouse performs picking on the object and displays the 3D coordinates of the point clicked in the forms title bar.</p>
    <p>The example demonstrates the setup of ILNumerics Visualization Engine in a WindowsForms project on .NET 5.0.</p>
    <p>Note, that a license is embedded allowing to compile the unchanged project. Get a trial license in order to modify the code: <a href="https://ilnumerics.net/download.html">download trial</a>.</p>
