  <Description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>Two transparent areas are created in a line plot in order to emphasize certain regions of the plot. The area will 
    always be transparently rendered on top of the line and markers and follow interactions by the user: panning, zoom and 
    even rotation (for 3D plots) are supported.</p>
