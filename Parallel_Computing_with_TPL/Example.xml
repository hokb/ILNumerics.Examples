  <Title>Parallel Computing with TPL and ILNumerics</Title>
  <Description>
        <![CDATA[
    <p>This examples demonstrates how ILNumerics can be used with TPL without threading or memory issues.</p>
    <p>ILNumerics arrays can be used by separate threads in parallel - as long as all data are separated. Currently, each thread must load its own dataset. 
    ILNumerics.Array&lt;T&gt; cannot be shared across thread boundaries. In some configurations, you may have to consider certain 
    properties of TPL, too. This example describes your options and gives some background. Please, refer to the comments in the code below.</p>
    <p>Topics covered: Configuring the ILNumerics thread pool, configuring the native memory pool on a thread base, investigating memory issues.</p>
