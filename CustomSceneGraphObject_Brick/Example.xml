  <Description>
    This example creates a brick class as fully featured custom scene graph object: the class fits into the copying scheme of ILNumerics Visualization Engine and is 
    available to the rendering driver in the synchronized copy of the scene graph. It demonstrates which methods need to get implemented for which fetaure to work. 
    See the accompanying documentation here: http://ilnumerics.net/custom-scene-graph-objects.html
