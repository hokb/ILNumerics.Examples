  <Title>Sharing Scenes between Drivers/Panels - Global Scenes, Local Scenes, Synchronized Copies</Title>
  <Description>
    This example demonstrates how a global scene can be shared between two panels and how events are registered on objects of that scene.
    It registers event handlers on both: the global scene as well as on the synchronized scenes maintained by each panel individually. Clicking on an visible object will
    trigger both: events registered on the global scene as well as events registered on the individual synchronized copies. Events are displayed in the output window of Visual Studio.
    While sharing the same global scene, both panels maintain individual graphical elements at the same time. The 'LocalScene' of any driver is utilized in order to display 
    individual labels for each panel.
