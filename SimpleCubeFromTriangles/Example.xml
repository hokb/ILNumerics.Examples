  <Title>Cheap cube made out of simple triangles</Title>
  <Description>
    <p>The Triangles class is used to construct a cube from triangles. Corner positions are defined only once and connected by indices efficiently. The cube is lit and the normals 
    are shared between adjacent edges (hence the light looks a little funky here). A LineStrip object is used to emphasize the edges of the cube.</p>
    <p>This example demonstrates the trade off one often has to make when building large...huge scenes. The cube here is constructed by sharing vertices which can lead to improved 
    performance when a large number of such cubes are to be rendered. However, the vertex sharing comes with limitations in configurability and brings disadvantages in lighting.</p>
