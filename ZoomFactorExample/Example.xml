      <![CDATA[<p>This example creates a very simple GUI application: 3 buttons are used to control the zoom settings of a simple 3D camera based scene. Next to 
      zooming in and out a third button allows to reset the zoom setting in order to show all content of the scene. This differs from the regular Camera.Reset() 
      method! The ShowAll() method implemented here takes the actual extend of the combined objects in the scene into account and adjusts the Camera.ZoomFactor
      property according to the real extend.</p>
      <p>ShowAll() is implemented as an extension method for demonstration purposes.</p>]]>
