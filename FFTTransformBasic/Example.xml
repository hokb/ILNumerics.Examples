  <Title>FFT - Basic Transformations</Title>
  <Description>Loads a dataset of binary samples from a file and does a 
  number of transformations on it. The example shows how to do a simple fft 
  transform and how to present the results as line plots in 3 individual plot cubes 
  in a single ILPanel control. The plot cubes show the original time domain signal, 
the transformed result as real and imaginary parts separately, and the computed magnitudes 
of the frequency bins. All plot cubes receive some configurations, like axis configurations, 
labeling and annotations (title, legend).</Description>
