  <Title>Saving Scenes to Images</Title>
  <Description>
      <![CDATA[<p>A form is created showing a simple scene and two buttons. One button saves the current scene with all user interactions (rotation, zoom etc.) to a file on disk.</p>
      <p>The other button creates a new scene in memory without showing it in the panel. The offline scene is then also saved to a file on disk.</p>
      <p>This demonstrates how to handle scenes w/o Panel, using GDIDriver for saving scenes to image files, and which actions are needed in order to trigger rendering for 
      Panel without Windows.Forms Paint events.</p>]]>
