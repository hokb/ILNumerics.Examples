  <Title>Updates for Dynamic Scene, Shared Buffers</Title>
  <Description>
      <![CDATA[<p>A ILNumerics.Drawing.Gear is used to demonstrate the effect on dynamic updates to shared buffers in a 3D scene.</p>
      <p>
    The application creates a gear shape (preconfigured Triangles) and a line strip which is used to mark some vertices of the gear. 
    Lines and triangles share their Positions buffer. 
    A UI slider is utilized in order to dynamically modify vertices of the triangles. Since both shapes share their buffers, 
    updating the positions buffer of the triangles does at the same time also updates the Lines shape. </p>
