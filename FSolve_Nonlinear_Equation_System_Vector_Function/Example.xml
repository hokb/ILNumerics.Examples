  <Description>
      <![CDATA[<p>ILNumerics Optimization Toolbox is used to solve a system of nonlinear equations F(x) = 0. The equations are wrapped 
      into a dedicated class and assemble a cost function which returns the output of 4 nonlinear functions according to the input 
      of a 4 element vector. The Powell's Dog Leg least squares solver is used to find the minimum of </p>
      <pre>argmin { || F(x) ||^2, subject to x in R^n</pre>
      <p>The minimizer found corresponds to the solution x of the original equation F(x) = 0. The example is easily extensible to more dimensions and arbitrary cost functions F(x).</p>]]>
