  <Title>Smoothed Heightmap Interpolation in a combined, stacked surface Plot</Title>
  <Description>
    <p>Heightmap data 20 x 20 is plotted as a flat, colormap encoded surface in its original resolution. A smoothed version of the 
    data is computed via 2D spline interpolation, using Interpolation.interpn(). A second surface plot is created based on this 
    smoothed height data and plotted in the same plotcube stacked on top of the flat original data.</p>
    <p>The example also demonstrates several configuration options: the plot cubes Z label is repositioned and the text for the label
    specified. A colorbar is added to the scene and its labels are postfixed with a string showing the scale unit. Colormaps are selected for both 
    surfaces. The surface with the smoothed data has specular lighting enabled.</p>
    <p>Lesson: Make the smoothed surface transparent and hide its wireframe. Watch the 
    scene from a 2D view. Double clicking with the mouse resets the scene to a 2D view. This creates an overlay over the original data 
  with 'new' information showing details between the original grid points.</p>
