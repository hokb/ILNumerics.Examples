  <Title>Fitting Scattered Data in Chunks - Scalable for Huge Data (Kriging)</Title>
  <Description>
      <![CDATA[
    <p>A scalable data fitter for large scattered data point clouds. Kriging interpolation is used to fit
    a surface to a given set of scattered (random) data points in 2D. Since too many data points (10000) are provided to
    be handled at once by kriging the set is split into multiple tiles. Each tile consists out of several grids and is computed
    individually by taking the source data points inside its region as well as some surrounding data points into account. </p>
    <p>This example was made to show the interactive capabilities of ILNumerics Visualization Engine. It displays the state of the 
    computation of the tiles continously: the resulting tiles are shown in the final surface while they are being computed. A simple progress 
    bar (made out of ScreenObject) is constantly updated and shown to the user as an overlay of the scene. The computation is done 
    in a background thread, utilizing C#'s <code>async, await</code> feature. Updates to the scene from a background thread are 
    demonstrated as well as several options to manage the threads during the computations.</p>
