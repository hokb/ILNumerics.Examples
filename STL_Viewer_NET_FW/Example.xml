  <Title>STL Model Viewer (.NET Framework, WindowsForms)</Title>
  <Description>
    This app serves as a working STL model viewer. It loads the famous 'bunny.stl' (Stanford, included)
    at startup. The model is viewed in a regular Camera node, i.e.: one can interact by rotation, translation, panning and zoom.
    <p>Other models can be loaded from STL files. For display a Triangles shape is used. Lighting is enabled.</p>
    <p>
      The example demonstrates the setup of ILNumerics Visualization Engine in a WindowsForms project on .NET Core. After download and
      extraction, make sure that the required dependencies are referenced from the GAC: ILNumerics.Core, ILNumerics.Computing, and ILNumerics.Drawing. See: <a href="https://ilnumerics.net/first-drawing-module.html">getting started</a>.
