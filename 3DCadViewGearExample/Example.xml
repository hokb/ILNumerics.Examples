  <Description>
    This example creates a simple form with 4 individual areas, one for each quadrant of the panel. 3 plot cubes display 2D views of an STL model.
    The 4th view is a 3D view of the same model which is individually rotatable by the user. The ILCamera.ScreenRect property is used to   
    distribute the models over the quadrants. The same model is loaded only once and reused for all views. No memory will be copied for the views. 
    The example also includes the sample code for loading STL mesh data from files in binary and text mode.
