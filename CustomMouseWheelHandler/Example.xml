  <Title>Custom Mouse Wheel Handler for Camera</Title>
  <Description>
    The example demonstrates how the behavior of the mouse wheel can be changed on a regular camera. It registers a custom mouse wheel event handler
    on the camera and moves the camera forward or backwards with the mouse wheel events. The modification is restricted within certain limits to ensure a stable 
    user experience.
