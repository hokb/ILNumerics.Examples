  <Title>Spline Path connecting 3D Points</Title>
  <Description>
    The splinepath() function from ILNumerics Interpolation Toolbox is used to create a spline path connecting 20 random points in 
    3D space. Original points are marked as dot-markers. The interpolating line is a regular blue line, realized as 3D line plot. 
    The application provides a simple GUI with a button "Shuffle" and a slider. Pressing the button repositions the points in 3D space randomly. 
    The slider controls the derivative of the spline interpolator at the lower end of the connecting line. All controls are used interactively and show the result immediately in the scene.
