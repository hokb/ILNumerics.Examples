  <Title>Smooth Plotting using SplinePlot</Title>
  <Description>
    <p>
      A simple plot demonstrates how to use ILNumerics.Drawing.Plotting.SplinePlot to visualize smooth spline connected sample values. Two plots are created by using
      LinePlot and SplinePlot. LinePlot draws a straight line through the points. SplinePlot created a smooth curve as not-a-knot spline,
      connecting the same data points.
