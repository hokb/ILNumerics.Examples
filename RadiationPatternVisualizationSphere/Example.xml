  <Description>
    <p>Directional, spherical radiation measurement data is read from a CSV file and is converted to a
    parametric surface. Magnitude data forms the height of the sample points on a sphere and is additionally encoded as the color of the sample points.
    The deformed 'sphere' is placed onto a 'ground' area (RectangleFilled) and can be fully rotated / translated
    interactively with the mouse. Lighting is enabled by default. </p>
    <p>Note, that the sphere is not fully closed, since only data for the angles 0...359 are provided.</p>
    <p>The Camera is configured so that the pattern surface is placed into the center of the scene, together with the center of rotations with the mouse.</p>
    <p>Variation: the data can also be visualized by means of a regular Surface. This would lead to a view similar to this image: </p>
