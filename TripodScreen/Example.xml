  <Title>Synchronized Cameras - A Custom Tripod Class</Title>
  <Description>
    <![CDATA[
    <p>This example demonstrates the setup of a 2nd Camera object in the main scene. The new Camera hosts a simple 'tripod' made out of 3 labeled lines. Both cameras 
    are synchronized so that the interaction applied to the main camera is similarly applied to the new camera. Therefore, a custom tripod is realized. It always follows the 
    rotations of the main camera, indicating the directions of the 3 main axes: X,Y and Z.</p>
