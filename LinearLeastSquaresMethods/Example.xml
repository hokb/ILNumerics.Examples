  <Title>Linear Least Squares Data Fitting Example</Title>
  <Description>
      <![CDATA[<p>Two example applications are combined in this Windows.Forms GUI: (1) fitting a line to measurement data using pinv and (2) fitting polynoms 
      of various degrees to another measurement dataset using ridge_regression.</p> 
    <p>Each example is activated by an individual button on the main example GUI. The ILNumerics Visualization Engine is utilized in order to plot the 
    function and the solution together with the path passed from the start to the minimum.</p>
    <p>This example serves as accompanying material for the online documentation for <a href="http://ilnumerics.net/linear-least-squares.html">
    linear least squares</a>.</p>
