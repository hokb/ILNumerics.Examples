    <p>
      A simple Sphere is created and added to a common Camera node. This example demonstrates how to apply and modify light to filled objects. The color and shape of the specular reflection is
      modified for the Sphere, the position of the default light in the scene is altered in order to move the reflection to a place where it becomes better visible.
